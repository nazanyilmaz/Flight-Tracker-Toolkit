<p>
  I developed a Flight Radar system using Redux-Toolkit features. Flight information can be followed on two different screens: MAp and List.
You are monitoring 300 different flights over USA airspace.Flight information is updated periodically every 5 seconds.
A pagination feature is used to make it easier to follow the list page.
It can follow the road map between the start and end terminals of the flight. You can see if there is a delay. Both the monitoring area coordinates and the number of aircraft whose flights are monitored can be increased</p>
